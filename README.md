# Touchscreen-data-processing-scripts

These are two main scripts used to analyze differentially rewarded associative learning tasks using the Bussey-Saksida animal touchscreen platorm.

##First script is the VMCL script: VMCLTraining.R
Input = one csv file with the raw data of all subjects ran in experiments each day. 

  Each column are variables wanting to be extracted into a separate csv for plotting. 
  
Output = multiple csv files, each file represents one variable and its trend for each subject over days of training.

Note: scripts very inflexible: Need to manually specify number of animals trained, and how many days trained.
