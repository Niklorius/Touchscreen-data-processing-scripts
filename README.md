# Touchscreen-data-processing-scripts

These are two main scripts used to analyze differentially rewarded associative learning tasks using a touchscreen platform.
Touchscreen platform machines developed by Bussey Saksida Touch Systems (Lafayette Instruments).

First script is the VMCL script: VMCLTraining.R
Input = one csv file with the raw data of all subjects ran in experiments each day. 
  Each column are variables wanting to be extracted into a separate csv for plotting. 
Output = multiple csv files, each file represents one variable and its trend for each subject over days of training.
